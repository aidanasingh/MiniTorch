* Docs: https://minitorch.github.io/

This is effectively a fork of MiniTorch, a learning tool which re-implements all functional abstractions of PyTorch and hardware optimizations, making it optimized for large deep learning models. Please see the latest commit for all of Aidan Singh's contributions. The template was created by Sasha Rush, Professor at Cornell Tech, who was a frequent contributer to PyTorch.

To get started training MNIST classifiers with this library, run
```
pip install python-mnist
mnist_get_data.sh
```


* Tests:

```
python run_tests.py
```
